<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A standardized scale for quantifying facial attractiveness can be valuable in various fields, including psychology, aesthetics, and artificial intelligence. It provides an objective framework for studying human perception, enabling researchers to analyze the factors influencing attractiveness and their impact on social interactions and self-esteem. In medical and cosmetic fields, such a scale aids in assessing management outcomes, guiding surgical enhancements, and developing personalized aesthetic recommendations. Additionally, in Computer Vision, it supports the development of algorithms for facial recognition and beauty-related applications.

Here's why EAS is useful:

* It streamlines communication by allowing better understanding without direct visualization of a subject
* Simplicity makes it easy to adopt and use
* You should practice objective thinking and use of the scientific process in other aspects of your life

This scale provides a standardized quantitative measure of facial attractiveness but is inherently subjective and influenced by cultural, personal, and contextual factors. It should not be viewed as an absolute or definitive assessment, as perceptions of beauty vary widely. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all contributors who have helped expand this tool!

<!-- Explaining the Scale -->
## The Ermita Attractiveness Scale

The EAS includes two disctinct components:

1. Attractiveness with a mask (AMS)
2. Attractiveness without a mask (NMS)

Both scales run from 0-10, however, AMS is meant as a screening tool in the absence of enough data to determine a definitive NMS score.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

The following tables provide a structured framework for interpreting AMS and NMS scores, categorizing them into different risk levels, and guiding appropriate actions. It helps standardize decision-making by offering clear recommendations based on score ranges, ensuring consistency in assessments and interventions.

### AMS-based Decision-Making

| AMS Score | Classification       | Recommended Action          |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| 0-5       | Deficient | No action needed            |
| 6-7       | Mild      | Further observation required |
| 8-9       | Moderate  | Consider intervention       |
| 10      | Severe    | Immediate action needed     |

### NMS-based Decision-Making

| NMS Score | Classification       | Recommended Action          |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| 0-4       | Deficient | No action needed            |
| 5-6       | Mild      | Further observation required |
| 7-8       | Moderate  | Consider intervention       |
| 9-10      | Severe    | Immediate action needed     |

### Writing an Assessment

This is what an example of an assessment of *Person X* using EAS would look like:

| AMS-NMS score | Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| 7-none | **A>** Cute, mild, AMS 7
| 8-5 | **A>** Cute, mild, NMS 5 (AMS 8)
| 9-4 | **A>** Not Cute, NMS 4 (AMS 9)
| none-9 | **A>** Cute, severe, NMS 9

<!-- Modified EAS -->
## Modified EAS

The Modified Ermita Attractiveness Scale (mEAS) introduces an additional variable, known as an **X factor**, which accounts for intangible qualities that may not be captured by AMS or NMS alone. This factor includes elements such as charisma, confidence, or an unquantifiable appeal that significantly enhances perceived attractiveness. When present, the X factor can justify stepping up the recommended action for a given AMS or NMS classification, ensuring that assessments better reflect real-world attractiveness dynamics beyond physical features alone.

Explanation:

* X Factor Presence: If present, it elevates the classification by one level, making the attractiveness assessment more dynamic
* Adjusted Classification: Accounts for both AMS/NMS scores and the X factor‚Äôs influence
* Recommended Action: Steps up intervention if the X factor justifies it

### Writing an mEAS Assessment

| AMS Score | NMS Score | X Factor Presence | Assessment | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0-5| 0-4      | No               | A> Not cute, NMS 4 X-0 (AMS 5)            | No action needed            |
| 0-5       | 0-4      | Yes              | A> Cute, mild, NMS 4 X-1 (AMS 5)                 | Further observation required |
| 6-7       | 5-6      | No               | A> Cute, mild, NMS 6 X-0 (AMS 7)                 | Further observation required |
| 6-7       | 5-6      | Yes              | A> Cute, moderate, NMS 6 X-1 (AMS 7)             | Consider intervention       |
| 8-9       | 7-8      | No               | A> Cute, moderate, NMS 8 X-0 (AMS 9)             | Consider intervention       |
| 8-9       | 7-8      | Yes              | Cute, severe, NMS 8 X-1 (AMS 9)               | Immediate action needed     |
| 10        | 9-10     | No               | Cute, severe, NMS 10 X-0 (AMS 10)               | Immediate action needed     |
| 10        | 9-10     | Yes              | Cute, extreme, NMS 10 X-1 (AMS 10)              | Priority action required    |
