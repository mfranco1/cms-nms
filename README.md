<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A standardized scale for quantifying facial attractiveness can be valuable in various fields, including psychology, aesthetics, and artificial intelligence. It provides an objective framework for studying human perception, enabling researchers to analyze the factors influencing attractiveness and their impact on social interactions and self-esteem. In medical and cosmetic fields, such a scale aids in assessing management outcomes, guiding surgical enhancements, and developing personalized aesthetic recommendations. Additionally, in Computer Vision, it supports the development of algorithms for facial recognition and beauty-related applications.

Here's why EAS is useful:

* It streamlines communication by allowing better understanding without direct visualization of a subject
* Simplicity makes it easy to adopt and use
* You should practice objective thinking and use of the scientific process in other aspects of your life

This scale provides a standardized quantitative measure of facial attractiveness but is inherently subjective and influenced by cultural, personal, and contextual factors. It should not be viewed as an absolute or definitive assessment, as perceptions of beauty vary widely. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all contributors who have helped expand this tool!

<!-- Explaining the Scale -->
## The Ermita Attractiveness Scale

The EAS includes two disctinct components:

1. Attractiveness with a mask (AMS)
2. Attractiveness without a mask (NMS)

Both scales run from 0-10, however, AMS is meant as a screening tool in the absence of enough data to determine a definitive NMS score.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

The following tables provide a structured framework for interpreting AMS and NMS scores, categorizing them into different risk levels, and guiding appropriate actions. It helps standardize decision-making by offering clear recommendations based on score ranges, ensuring consistency in assessments and interventions.

### AMS-based Decision-Making

| AMS Score | Classification       | Recommended Action          |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| 0-5       | Deficient | No action needed            |
| 6-7       | Mild      | Further observation required |
| 8-9       | Moderate  | Consider intervention       |
| 10      | Severe    | Immediate action needed     |

### NMS-based Decision-Making

| NMS Score | Classification       | Recommended Action          |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| 0-4       | Deficient | No action needed            |
| 5-6       | Mild      | Further observation required |
| 7-8       | Moderate  | Consider intervention       |
| 9-10      | Severe    | Immediate action needed     |
